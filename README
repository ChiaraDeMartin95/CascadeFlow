How to run the full analysis:

1. QC: QCPlots.C
2. Resolution: Resolution.C
3. ProcessTree.C with isApplyWeights = 0 in CommonVar.h 
4. ComputeV2.C with isApplyWeights = 0 in CommonVar.h 
5. ProcessTree.C with isApplyWeights = 1 in CommonVar.h 
6. ComputeV2.C with isApplyWeights = 1 in CommonVar.h 
7. FitV2orPol.C in all multiplicity classes (use script_AnalysisWorkflow.sh)

To plot results:
MeanSigmaPurityMultRatio.C --> To plot mean, sigma, purity, v2, Pzs2, Pz (vs Psi and Pt) for different multiplicity classes
CompareXiPlusMinus.C --> To plot same quantities above vs charge
PzsVsCentrality.C --> To plot Pzs2 vs centrality 
CompareResults.C --> see options in the macro itself
